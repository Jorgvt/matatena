    "Now that we've been able to implement the basic functionalities of the game in Python, our next step is to implement it as a `gym.Env` so that it can be used easily to train reinforcement learning models. As a starting point, we will be following the docs: https://www.gymlibrary.dev/content/environment_creation/.\n",

    "They remind us to add the `metadata` attribute to specify the render-mode (`human`, `rgb_array` or `ansi`) and the framerate. Every environment should support the render-mode `None`, and you don't need to add it explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have almost defined the environment completelly before, we don't need to add a lot of information to this class (we can inherit from the one we defined before); but we have to explicitly define the attributes `self.observation_space` and `self.action_space`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.action_space`: Our agents can only choose them column in which they want to place the dice, so our action space is going to be restricted to a number between 0 and 2 (assuming the board has 3 columns, but could depend on it directly).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.observation_space`: What does an agent see? It makes sense to provide all the information available: Its current board, the opponent's board and the dice it has to place. We can implement this easily with a `spaces.Dict`. The different boards can be encoded as `spaces.Box` with `dtype=np.uint8` so that they are discrete environments by with an array-like shape. It should work very similarly with a `spaces.MultiDiscrete` environment for example."
