    "text": "Knucklebones is a simple game in which a dice is rolled and one of the two players must place it in their corresponding board. Each player can only choose the column in which the dice is placed, and if any dice is already placed in that column, the following is put behind. If there are more than one dice with the same number, their score is added and then multiplied by the number of times it appears. For example, if a column has two 6s, their values add up to 24, but if a column has a 6 and a 5, the total score would be 11.\n\nThe basic board is a 3x3 grid."
