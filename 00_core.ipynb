    "Knucklebones is a simple game in which a dice is rolled and one of the two players must place it in their corresponding board. Each player can only choose the column in which the dice is placed, and if any dice is already placed in that column, the following is put behind. If there are more than one dice with the same number, their score is multiplied. For example, if a column has two 6s, their values add up to 36, but if a column has a 6 and a 5, the total score would be 11.\n",
